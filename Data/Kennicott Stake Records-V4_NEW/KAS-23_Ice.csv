NOTE,"1) Ice density used to calculate mass balance: 0.9 g/cm3.
2) Stake reading should refers to length of stake above the surface (i.e. measurement from top of stake down to snow, ice, firn or debris surface), the depth of snow/debris should also be measured in that case.
3) The snow depth should include all snow types (fresh or old), and if density measurement is applicable, please measure densities of all snow types and provide a weighted mean (regarding to their depths).
4) Please mark the melt out stakes by ""Melted Out"" in Status column. The new or redrilled stakes should be in a new row which is marked by ""New Installation"" in Status column. They were used to calculate some cell values.",Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7,Unnamed: 8,Unnamed: 9,Unnamed: 10,Unnamed: 11,Unnamed: 12,Unnamed: 13,Unnamed: 14,Unnamed: 15,Unnamed: 16,Unnamed: 17,Unnamed: 18,Unnamed: 19
